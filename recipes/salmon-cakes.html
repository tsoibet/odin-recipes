    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a recipe for my Grandmother's famous salmon cakes. It is a family recipe that has been passed down through generations. Serve with macaroni and cheese or any other type of side dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 &#40;14.75 ounce&#41; can salmon, drained and flaked</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pick through the salmon and remove any bones. In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs and add the diced onion, salmon and pepper. Mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Shape into 2 ounce patties; about 7 or 8 patties. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the oil. Fry each patty for 5 minutes on each side or until crispy and golden brown.</li>
